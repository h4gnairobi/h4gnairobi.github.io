Geeklist hack4good unites the world's software engineers, hackers, ui/ux designers, product developers, founders, thought leaders and civic-minded organisations from around the world to build solutions to humanity's greatest problems.\r\n\r\nThis time, we were tackling Climate Change, and Nairobi was one of the participating cities. \r\n\r\n### The Hackathon\r\nAll the planning and work we put in it culminated in the hackathon that took place at iHub Nairobi between 12th and 14th September, 2014. Approximately 20 attendees, mainly from the tech community in Nairobi came together to build amazing solutions to these [15 global challenges](https://geekli.st/hackathon/hack4good-06/nairobi) around climate change.\r\n\r\nThey came up with 4 teams:\r\n\r\n 1. [Zingu](https://geekli.st/hackathon/hack4good-06/project/54153e0e4264f8d30788f994) - To provide better water storage strategies\r\n 2. [Boresha Mazingira](https://geekli.st/hackathon/hack4good-06/project/5413cea09e037feb04344c02) - To create awareness of environment based initiatives\r\n 3. [Carbon](https://geekli.st/hackathon/hack4good-06/project/5415a466c23bd4e10b1befa9) - To check your environment friendliness\r\n 4. [Sloop](https://geekli.st/hackathon/hack4good-06/project/5413cb4bcb6b51cd049cebbf) - A to do app for daily environmental tasks\r\n\r\nZingu came out in first place, followed by Boresha Mazingira and Carbon, who tied in 2nd place. They all proceeded to the global judging round. Sloop was judged as part of the virtual teams, since they collaborated with other members from around the world. They also went through to the global judging round.\r\n\r\nThe compelling presentations by the teams in Nairobi are on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwQiWWmJcXc&list=UU3ofNKrKZBn8AvFeG3A6w6A).\r\n\r\nThe global round of judging is scheduled for Wednesday, 17th September. You can watch the [live-stream](http://bit.ly/hack4goodlive) as the global judging panel takes on this.\r\n\r\nWe wish all the teams all the best in the global judging round. Six finalists will get a chance to present their idea at the upcoming Mashable Social Good Summit alongside UN Climate Week in NY between 21-22 September.","google":"UA-54987258-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
